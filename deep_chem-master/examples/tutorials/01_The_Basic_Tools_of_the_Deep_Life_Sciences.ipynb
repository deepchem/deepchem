        "# Tutorial 1: The Basic Tools of the Deep Life Sciences\n",
        "Welcome to DeepChem's introductory tutorial for the deep life sciences. This series of notebooks is a step-by-step guide for you to get to know the new tools and techniques needed to do deep learning for the life sciences. We'll start from the basics, assuming that you're new to machine learning and the life sciences, and build up a repertoire of tools and techniques that you can use to do meaningful work in the life sciences.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Scope:** This tutorial will encompass both the machine learning and data handling needed to build systems for the deep life sciences.\n",

This is a very important property in drug development: if a proposed drug isn't soluble enough, you probably won't be able to get enough into the patient's bloodstream to have a therapeutic effect.  The first thing we need is a data set of measured solubilities for real molecules.  One of the core components of DeepChem is MoleculeNet, a diverse collection of chemical and molecular data sets.  For this tutorial, we can use the Delaney solubility data set."

We therefore tell it which representation we want to use, or in more technical language, how to \"featurize\" the data.
