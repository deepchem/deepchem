  """Load QM8 dataset

  QM8 is the dataset used in a study on modeling quantum
  mechanical calculations of electronic spectra and excited
  state energy of small molecules. Multiple methods, including
  time-dependent density functional theories (TDDFT) and
  second-order approximate coupled-cluster (CC2), are applied to
  a collection of molecules that include up to eight heavy atoms
  (also a subset of the GDB-17 database). In our collection,
  there are four excited state properties calculated by four
  different methods on 22 thousand samples:

  S0 -> S1 transition energy E1 and the corresponding oscillator strength f1

  S0 -> S2 transition energy E2 and the corresponding oscillator strength f2

  E1, E2, f1, f2 are in atomic units. f1, f2 are in length representation

  Random splitting is recommended for this dataset.

  The source data contain:

  - qm8.sdf: molecular structures
  - qm8.sdf.csv: tables for molecular properties

    - Column 1: Molecule ID (gdb9 index) mapping to the .sdf file
    - Columns 2-5: RI-CC2/def2TZVP
    - Columns 6-9: LR-TDPBE0/def2SVP
    - Columns 10-13: LR-TDPBE0/def2TZVP
    - Columns 14-17: LR-TDCAM-B3LYP/def2TZVP

  Parameters
  ----------
  featurizer: Featurizer or str
    the featurizer to use for processing the data.  Alternatively you can pass
    one of the names from dc.molnet.featurizers as a shortcut.
  splitter: Splitter or str
    the splitter to use for splitting the data into training, validation, and
    test sets.  Alternatively you can pass one of the names from
    dc.molnet.splitters as a shortcut.  If this is None, all the data
    will be included in a single dataset.
  transformers: list of TransformerGenerators or strings
    the Transformers to apply to the data.  Each one is specified by a
    TransformerGenerator or, as a shortcut, one of the names from
    dc.molnet.transformers.
  reload: bool
    if True, the first call for a particular featurizer and splitter will cache
    the datasets to disk, and subsequent calls will reload the cached datasets.
  data_dir: str
    a directory to save the raw data in
  save_dir: str
    a directory to save the dataset in

  Note
  ----
  DeepChem 2.4.0 has turned on sanitization for this dataset by
  default.  For the QM8 dataset, this means that calling this
  function will return 21747 compounds instead of 21786 in the source
  dataset file.  This appears to be due to valence specification
  mismatches in the dataset that weren't caught in earlier more lax
  versions of RDKit.  Note that this may subtly affect benchmarking
  results on this dataset.
