class A2C(object):
    """
    Implements the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm for reinforcement learning.

    The algorithm is described in Mnih et al, "Asynchronous Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning"
    (https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01783).  This class supports environments with both discrete and
    continuous action spaces.  For discrete action spaces, the "action" argument passed to the
    environment is an integer giving the index of the action to perform.  The policy must output
    a vector called "action_prob" giving the probability of taking each action.  For continuous
    action spaces, the action is an array where each element is chosen independently from a
    normal distribution.  The policy must output two arrays of the same shape: "action_mean"
    gives the mean value for each element, and "action_std" gives the standard deviation for
    each element.  In either case, the policy must also output a scalar called "value" which
    is an estimate of the value function for the current state.

    The algorithm optimizes all outputs at once using a loss that is the sum of three terms:

    1. The policy loss, which seeks to maximize the discounted reward for each action.
    2. The value loss, which tries to make the value estimate match the actual discounted reward
        that was attained at each step.
    3. An entropy term to encourage exploration.

    This class supports Generalized Advantage Estimation as described in Schulman et al., "High-Dimensional
    Continuous Control Using Generalized Advantage Estimation" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02438).
    This is a method of trading off bias and variance in the advantage estimate, which can sometimes
    improve the rate of convergance.  Use the advantage_lambda parameter to adjust the tradeoff.

    This class supports Hindsight Experience Replay as described in Andrychowicz et al., "Hindsight
    Experience Replay" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01495).  This is a method that can enormously
    accelerate learning when rewards are very rare.  It requires that the environment state contains
    information about the goal the agent is trying to achieve.  Each time it generates a rollout, it
    processes that rollout twice: once using the actual goal the agent was pursuing while generating
    it, and again using the final state of that rollout as the goal.  This guarantees that half of
    all rollouts processed will be ones that achieved their goals, and hence received a reward.

    To use this feature, specify use_hindsight=True to the constructor.  The environment must have
    a method defined as follows:

    def apply_hindsight(self, states, actions, goal):
        ...
        return new_states, rewards

    The method receives the list of states generated during the rollout, the action taken for each one,
    and a new goal state.  It should generate a new list of states that are identical to the input ones,
    except specifying the new goal.  It should return that list of states, and the rewards that would
    have been received for taking the specified actions from those states.  The output arrays may be
    shorter than the input ones, if the modified rollout would have terminated sooner.


    Note
    ----
    Using this class on continuous action spaces requires that `tensorflow_probability` be installed.
