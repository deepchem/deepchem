class GAN(KerasModel):
    """Implements Generative Adversarial Networks.

    A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a type of generative model.  It
    consists of two parts called the "generator" and the "discriminator".  The
    generator takes random noise as input and transforms it into an output that
    (hopefully) resembles the training data.  The discriminator takes a set of
    samples as input and tries to distinguish the real training samples from the
    ones created by the generator.  Both of them are trained together.  The
    discriminator tries to get better and better at telling real from false data,
    while the generator tries to get better and better at fooling the discriminator.

    In many cases there also are additional inputs to the generator and
    discriminator.  In that case it is known as a Conditional GAN (CGAN), since it
    learns a distribution that is conditional on the values of those inputs.  They
    are referred to as "conditional inputs".

    Many variations on this idea have been proposed, and new varieties of GANs are
    constantly being proposed.  This class tries to make it very easy to implement
    straightforward GANs of the most conventional types.  At the same time, it
    tries to be flexible enough that it can be used to implement many (but
    certainly not all) variations on the concept.

    To define a GAN, you must create a subclass that provides implementations of
    the following methods:

    get_noise_input_shape()
    get_data_input_shapes()
    create_generator()
    create_discriminator()

    If you want your GAN to have any conditional inputs you must also implement:

    get_conditional_input_shapes()

    The following methods have default implementations that are suitable for most
    conventional GANs.  You can override them if you want to customize their
    behavior:

    create_generator_loss()
    create_discriminator_loss()
    get_noise_batch()

    This class allows a GAN to have multiple generators and discriminators, a model
    known as MIX+GAN.  It is described in Arora et al., "Generalization and
    Equilibrium in Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs)" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00573).
    This can lead to better models, and is especially useful for reducing mode
    collapse, since different generators can learn different parts of the
    distribution.  To use this technique, simply specify the number of generators
    and discriminators when calling the constructor.  You can then tell
    predict_gan_generator() which generator to use for predicting samples.

    This class implements Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs) as
    described in Arjovsky et al., "Wasserstein GAN" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875).
    A WGAN is conceptually rather different from a conventional GAN, but in
    practical terms very similar.  It reinterprets the discriminator (often called
    the "critic" in this context) as learning an approximation to the Earth Mover
    distance between the training and generated distributions.  The generator is
    then trained to minimize that distance.  In practice, this just means using
    slightly different loss functions for training the generator and discriminator.

    WGANs have theoretical advantages over conventional GANs, and they often work
    better in practice.  In addition, the discriminator's loss function can be
    directly interpreted as a measure of the quality of the model.  That is an
    advantage over conventional GANs, where the loss does not directly convey
    information about the quality of the model.

    The theory WGANs are based on requires the discriminator's gradient to be
    bounded.  The original paper achieved this by clipping its weights.  This
    class instead does it by adding a penalty term to the discriminator's loss, as
    described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00028.  This is sometimes found to
    produce better results.

    There are a few other practical differences between GANs and WGANs.  In a
    conventional GAN, the discriminator's output must be between 0 and 1 so it can
    be interpreted as a probability.  In a WGAN, it should produce an unbounded
    output that can be interpreted as a distance.

    When training a WGAN, you also should usually use a smaller value for
    generator_steps.  Conventional GANs rely on keeping the generator and
    discriminator "in balance" with each other.  If the discriminator ever gets
    too good, it becomes impossible for the generator to fool it and training
    stalls.  WGANs do not have this problem, and in fact the better the
    discriminator is, the easier it is for the generator to improve.  It therefore
    usually works best to perform several training steps on the discriminator for
    each training step on the generator.
