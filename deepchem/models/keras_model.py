class KerasModel(Model):
  """This is a DeepChem model implemented by a Keras model.

  This class provides several advantages over using the Keras
  model's fitting and prediction methods directly.

  1. It provides better integration with the rest of DeepChem,
     such as direct support for Datasets and Transformers.

  2. It defines the loss in a more flexible way.  In particular,
     Keras does not support multidimensional weight matrices,
     which makes it impossible to implement most multitask
     models with Keras.

  3. It provides various additional features not found in the
     Keras Model class, such as uncertainty prediction and
     saliency mapping.

  Here is a simple example of code that uses KerasModel to train
  a Keras model on a DeepChem dataset.

  >> keras_model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  >>    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1000, activation='tanh'),
  >>    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
  >> ])
  >> model = KerasModel(keras_model, loss=dc.models.losses.L2Loss())
  >> model.fit(dataset)

  The loss function for a model can be defined in two different
  ways.  For models that have only a single output and use a
  standard loss function, you can simply provide a
  dc.models.losses.Loss object.  This defines the loss for each
  sample or sample/task pair.  The result is automatically
  multiplied by the weights and averaged over the batch.  Any
  additional losses computed by model layers, such as weight
  decay penalties, are also added.

  For more complicated cases, you can instead provide a function
  that directly computes the total loss.  It must be of the form
  f(outputs, labels, weights), taking the list of outputs from
  the model, the expected values, and any weight matrices.  It
  should return a scalar equal to the value of the loss function
  for the batch.  No additional processing is done to the
  result; it is up to you to do any weighting, averaging, adding
  of penalty terms, etc.

  You can optionally provide an output_types argument, which
  describes how to interpret the model's outputs.  This should
  be a list of strings, one for each output. You can use an
  arbitrary output_type for a output, but some output_types are
  special and will undergo extra processing:

  - 'prediction': This is a normal output, and will be returned by predict().
    If output types are not specified, all outputs are assumed
    to be of this type.

  - 'loss': This output will be used in place of the normal
    outputs for computing the loss function.  For example,
    models that output probability distributions usually do it
    by computing unbounded numbers (the logits), then passing
    them through a softmax function to turn them into
    probabilities.  When computing the cross entropy, it is more
    numerically stable to use the logits directly rather than
    the probabilities.  You can do this by having the model
    produce both probabilities and logits as outputs, then
    specifying output_types=['prediction', 'loss'].  When
    predict() is called, only the first output (the
    probabilities) will be returned.  But during training, it is
    the second output (the logits) that will be passed to the
    loss function.

  - 'variance': This output is used for estimating the
    uncertainty in another output.  To create a model that can
    estimate uncertainty, there must be the same number of
    'prediction' and 'variance' outputs.  Each variance output
    must have the same shape as the corresponding prediction
    output, and each element is an estimate of the variance in
    the corresponding prediction.  Also be aware that if a model
    supports uncertainty, it MUST use dropout on every layer,
    and dropout most be enabled during uncertainty prediction.
    Otherwise, the uncertainties it computes will be inaccurate.

  - other: Arbitrary output_types can be used to extract outputs
    produced by the model, but will have no additional
    processing performed.

    be a pretrained model or a model with the same architecture. `value_map`
    is a variable-value dictionary. If no `value_map` is provided, the variable
    values are restored to the `source_model` from a checkpoint and a default
    `value_map` is created. `assignment_map` is a dictionary mapping variables
    from the `source_model` to the current model. If no `assignment_map` is
    provided, one is made from scratch and assumes the model is composed of
    several different layers, with the final one being a dense layer. include_top
    is used to control whether or not the final dense layer is used. The default

    Parameters
    ----------
    source_model: dc.KerasModel, required
      source_model can either be the pretrained model or a dc.KerasModel with
      the same architecture as the pretrained model. It is used to restore from
      a checkpoint, if value_map is None and to create a default assignment map
      if assignment_map is None
    assignment_map: Dict, default None
      Dictionary mapping the source_model variables and current model variables
    value_map: Dict, default None
      Dictionary containing source_model trainable variables mapped to numpy
      arrays. If value_map is None, the values are restored and a default
      variable map is created using the restored values
    checkpoint: str, default None
      the path to the checkpoint file to load.  If this is None, the most recent
      checkpoint will be chosen automatically.  Call get_checkpoints() to get a
      list of all available checkpoints
    model_dir: str, default None
      Restore model from custom model directory if needed
    include_top: bool, default True
        if True, copies the weights and bias associated with the final dense
        layer. Used only when assignment map is None
    inputs: List, input tensors for model
        if not None, then the weights are built for both the source and self.
        This option is useful only for models that are built by
        subclassing tf.keras.Model, and not using the functional API by tf.keras
