class ChemCeption(nn.Module):
    """
    Implements the ChemCeption model that leverages the representational capacities
    of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict molecular properties.

    The model is based on the description in Goh et al., "Chemception: A Deep
    Neural Network with Minimal Chemistry Knowledge Matches the Performance of
    Expert-developed QSAR/QSPR Models" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.06689.pdf).
    The authors use an image based representation of the molecule, where pixels
    encode different atomic and bond properties. More details on the image repres-
    entations can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02238

    The model consists of a Stem Layer that reduces the image resolution for the
    layers to follow. The output of the Stem Layer is followed by a series of
    Inception-Resnet blocks & a Reduction layer. Layers in the Inception-Resnet
    blocks process image tensors at multiple resolutions and use a ResNet style
    skip-connection, combining features from different resolutions. The Reduction
    layers reduce the spatial extent of the image by max-pooling and 2-strided
    convolutions. More details on these layers can be found in the ChemCeption
    paper referenced above. The output of the final Reduction layer is subject to
    a Global Average Pooling, and a fully-connected layer maps the features to
    downstream outputs.

    In the ChemCeption paper, the authors perform real-time image augmentation by
    rotating images between 0 to 180 degrees. This can be done during model
    training by setting the augment argument to True.
