    (Sequence Alignment Map) files. This class extracts Query Name, Query
    Sequence, Query Length, Reference Name, Reference Start, CIGAR, Mapping
    Quality, is_reverse and Query Qualities of the alignment in the BAM file.

    This is the default featurizer used by BAMLoader, and it extracts the
    following fields from each read in each BAM file in the given order:-
    - Column 0: Query Name
    - Column 1: Query Sequence

    - Column 6: Mapping Quality
    - Column 7: is_reverse
    - Column 8: Query Quality Scores
    - Column 9: Pileup Information (if get_pileup=True)

    Additionally, we can also get pileups from BAM files by setting
    get_pileup=True.A pileup is a summary of the alignment of reads
    at each position in a reference sequence. Specifically, it
    provides information on the position on the reference genome,
    the depth of coverage (i.e., the number of reads aligned to that
    position), and the actual bases from the aligned reads at that
    position, along with their quality scores. This data structure
    is useful for identifying variations, such as single nucleotide
    polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, and deletions by comparing the
    aligned reads to the reference genome. A pileup can be visualized
    as a vertical stack of aligned sequences, showing how each read
    matches or mismatches the reference at each position.
    In DeepVariant, pileups are utilized during the initial stages to
    select candidate windows for further analysis.
