    It expects each datapoint to be a string, which may be either a filename or a

    If the string ends in .pdb, .sdf, or .mol2, it is assumed to be a file in the
    corresponding format.  The positions and elements of all atoms contained in
    the file are loaded.  RDKit is used to compute formal and partial charges.
