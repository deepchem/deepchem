    environments.

    In many applications, it's desirable to look at binding pockets on
    macromolecules which may be good targets for potential ligands or
    other molecules to interact with. A `BindingPocketFeaturizer`
    expects to be given a macromolecule, and a list of pockets to
    featurize on that macromolecule. These pockets should be of the form
    produced by a `dc.dock.BindingPocketFinder`, that is as a list of
    `dc.utils.CoordinateBox` objects.

    The base featurization in this class's featurization is currently
    very simple and counts the number of residues of each type present
    in the pocket. It's likely that you'll want to overwrite this
    implementation for more sophisticated downstream usecases. Note that
    this class's implementation will only work for proteins and not for
    other macromolecules
