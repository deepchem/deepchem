    """Computes the values for different Feature on given batch.
    It works as a helper function to coulomb matrix.

    This function takes in a batch of Molecules represented as Coulomb Matrix.

    It proceeds as follows:

    - It calculates the Number of atoms per molecule by counting all the non
    zero elements(numbers) of every molecule layer in matrix in one dimension.

    - The Gaussian distance is calculated using the Euclidean distance between
    the Cartesian coordinates of two atoms. The distance value is then passed
    through a Gaussian function, which transforms it into a continuous value.

    - Then using number of atom per molecule, calculates the atomic charge by
    looping over the molecule layer in the Coulomb matrix and takes the `2.4`
    root of the diagonal of `2X` of each molecule layer. `Undoing the Equation
    of coulomb matrix.`

    - Atom_membership is assigned as a commomn repeating integers for all the
    atoms for a specific molecule.

    - Distance Membership encodes spatial information, assigning closer values
    to atoms that are in that specific molecule. All initial Distances are
    added a start value to them which are unique to each molecule.

    Models Used in:

    * DTNN

    Parameters
    ----------
    X_b: np.ndarray
        It is a 3d Matrix containing information of each the atom's ionic
        interaction with other atoms in the molecule.
    distance_min: float (default -1)
        minimum distance of atom pairs (in Angstrom)
    distance_max: float (default = 18)
        maximum distance of atom pairs (in Angstrom)
    n_distance: int (default 100)
        granularity of distance matrix
        step size will be (distance_max-distance_min)/n_distance

    Returns
    -------
    atom_number: np.ndarray
        Atom numbers are assigned to each atom based on their atomic properties
        The atomic numbers are derived from the periodic table of elements.
        For example, hydrogen -> 1, carbon -> 6, and oxygen -> 8.
    gaussian_dist: np.ndarray
        Gaussian distance refers to the method of representing the pairwise
        distances between atoms in a molecule using Gaussian functions. The
        Gaussian distance is calculated using the Euclidean distance between
        the Cartesian coordinates of two atoms. The distance value is then
        passed through a Gaussian function, which transforms it into a
        continuous value.
    atom_mem: np.ndarray
        Atom membership refers to the binary representation of whether an atom
        belongs to a specific group or property within a molecule. It allows
        the model to incorporate domain-specific information and enhance its
        understanding of the molecule's properties and interactions.
    dist_mem_i: np.ndarray
        Distance membership i are utilized to encode spatial information and
        capture the influence of atom distances on the properties and
        interactions within a molecule. The inner membership function assigns
        higher values to atoms that are closer to the atoms' interaction
        region, thereby emphasizing the impact of nearby atoms.
    dist_mem_j: np.ndarray
        It captures the long-range effects and influences between atoms that
        are not in direct proximity but still contribute to the overall
        molecular properties. Distance membership j are utilized to encode
        spatial information and capture the influence of atom distances on the
        properties and interactions outside a molecule. The outer membership
        function assigns higher values to atoms that are farther to the atoms'
        interaction region, thereby emphasizing the impact of farther atoms.

    Many NLP Models like SeqToSeq has sentences as there inputs. We need to

    If the `reverse_input` is True, then the order of the input sequences is
    reversed before sending them into the encoder. This can improve performance
