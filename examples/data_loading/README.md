# Data Loading Examples

This directory demonstrates different ways to load datasets into DeepChem for downstream analysis.
Each example highlights a specific data loading approach, helping users choose the most suitable
method based on their dataset format and workflow.

- pandas_csv.py demonstrates how to load a dataset directly from a CSV file using Pandas,
  which is useful for quick experimentation with tabular data.

- sdf_load.py demonstrates how to load molecular datasets from SDF files using DeepChem’s
  SDFLoader, commonly used in cheminformatics workflows.
