We just give it a list of options for each hyperparameter and it exhaustively tries all combinations of them.\n",

    "We can see a few general patterns.  Using two layers with the larger learning rate doesn't work very well.  It seems the deeper model requires a smaller learning rate.  We also see that 20% dropout usually works better than 50%.  Once we narrow down the list of models based on these observations, all the validation scores are very close to each other, probably close enough that the remaining variation is mainly noise.  It doesn't seem to make much difference which of the remaining hyperparameter sets we use, so let's arbitrarily pick a single layer of width 1000 and learning rate of 0.0001.\n",

    "\n",
    "You might expect that the longer you train, the better your model will get, but that isn't usually true.  If you train too long, the model will usually start overfitting to irrelevant details of the training set.  You can tell when this happens because the validation set score stops increasing and may even decrease, while the score on the training set continues to improve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, we don't need to train lots of different models for different numbers of steps to identify the optimal number.  We just train it once, monitor the validation score, and keep whichever parameters maximize it.  This is called \"early stopping\".  DeepChem's `ValidationCallback` class can do this for us automatically.  In the example below, we have it compute the validation set's ROC AUC every 1000 training steps.  If you add the `save_dir` argument, it will also save a copy of the best model parameters to disk."
