We also see that 20% dropout usually works better than 50%.  Once we narrow down the list of models based on these observations, all the validation scores are very close to each other, probably close enough that the remaining variation is mainly noise.  It doesn't seem to make much difference which of the remaining hyperparameter sets we use, so let's arbitrarily pick a single layer of width 1000 and learning rate of 0.0001.\n",

        "You might expect that the longer you train, the better your model will get, but that isn't usually true.

DeepChem's `ValidationCallback` class can do this for us automatically.  In the example below, we have it compute the validation set's ROC AUC every 1000 training steps.
