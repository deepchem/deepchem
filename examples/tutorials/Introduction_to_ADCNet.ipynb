    "Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) can transform cancer treatment in the era of precision medicine by enabling targeted delivery of potent drugs to cancer cells, minimizing damage to healthy tissues. However, designing effective ADCs remains challenging due to the complex relationship between their molecular structures and therapeutic activities. To address this, we introduce ADCNet [[1]](#1), a unified deep learning framework that facilitates the rational design of ADCs. ADCNet integrates the protein representation learning model ESM-2 for antibody and antigen sequences with the small-molecule representation model FG-BERT for linker and payload SMILES strings, alongside the Drug-Antibody Ratio (DAR) value, to predict ADC activity with high accuracy."

    "\n",
    "With advancements in molecular biology, target-oriented drug discovery has become the dominant approach, aiming to identify selective and effective clinical candidates. Traditional small molecule inhibitors have shown success but suffer from limitations such as off-target effects, narrow therapeutic windows, and drug resistance. The development of monoclonal antibodies has addressed some of these issues by leveraging specific antigen expression, though their effectiveness against heterogeneous cancer cells remains limited. Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) emerged as an innovative solution, combining the targeting precision of antibodies with the cytotoxicity of toxins via suitable linkers, enhancing therapeutic efficacy while minimizing harm to healthy cells."

Dropout randomly disables a fraction of neurons during each training iteration, which forces the network to not rely too heavily on any one neuron and helps in learning more robust features, and activation function is used to specify the activation function used in the hidden layers of the model. <br>\n",

    "Finally, let's plot the loss curve to get better insights on our training and validation loss over epochs. So, visualizing the training and validation loss curves is necessary and helps us understand how well the model is learning over time. A steadily decreasing training loss indicates that the model is fitting the data, while the validation loss provides insight into how well the model generalizes to unseen data. If the validation loss starts increasing while the training loss continues to decrease, it may indicate overfitting. By examining these curves, we can diagnose issues such as underfitting, overfitting, or the need for further hyperparameter tuning."
