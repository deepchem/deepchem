    "Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) can transform cancer treatment in the era of precision medicine by enabling targeted delivery of potent drugs to cancer cells, minimizing damage to healthy tissues. However, designing effective ADCs remains challenging due to the complex relationship between their molecular structures and therapeutic activities. To address this, we introduce ADCNet [[1]](#1), a unified deep learning framework that facilitates the rational design of ADCs. ADCNet integrates the protein representation learning model ESM-2 for antibody and antigen sequences with the small-molecule representation model FG-BERT for linker and payload SMILES strings, alongside the Drug-Antibody Ratio (DAR) value, to predict ADC activity with high accuracy."

    "\n",
    "With advancements in molecular biology, target-oriented drug discovery has become the dominant approach, aiming to identify selective and effective clinical candidates. Traditional small molecule inhibitors have shown success but suffer from limitations such as off-target effects, narrow therapeutic windows, and drug resistance. The development of monoclonal antibodies has addressed some of these issues by leveraging specific antigen expression, though their effectiveness against heterogeneous cancer cells remains limited. Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) emerged as an innovative solution, combining the targeting precision of antibodies with the cytotoxicity of toxins via suitable linkers, enhancing therapeutic efficacy while minimizing harm to healthy cells."
