    "Next we create a model to implement our policy.  This model receives the current state of the environment (the pixels being displayed on the screen at this moment) as its input.  Given that input, it decides what action to perform.  In Pong there are three possible actions at any moment: move the paddle up, move it down, or leave it where it is.  The policy model produces a probability distribution over these actions.  It also produces a *value* output, which is interpreted as an estimate of how good the current state is.  This turns out to be important for efficient learning.\n",

Just from the screen image, you cannot tell whether the ball is moving to the left or to the right, so having memory is important.\n",
