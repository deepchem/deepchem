        "## **1. Introduction to the Ferminet Model:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The Ferminet model is a cutting-edge approach in quantum chemistry aimed at accurately predicting molecular properties. It leverages advanced neural network architectures to capture complex electron interactions within molecular systems, thus enabling precise quantum chemical calculations.\n",
