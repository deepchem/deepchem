Unfortunately, this interactivity comes at the price of portability, so we have included screenshots for this tutorial in addition to providing the code to generate the interactive visuals.

    "To simulate a drug discovery application, let's say you're a chemist tasked with identifying potential new therapeutics derived from ibuprofen. Ideally, the molecules you test would have limited toxicity. You've just developed the model above to predict the tox outcomes from Tox21 data and now you want to use it to do some first-pass screening of your derivatives. The standard workflow for a task like this might include drawing the molecules in a program like ChemDraw, exporting to SMILES format, importing into the notebook, then prepping the data and running it through your model.\n",

    "With TCW, we can shortcut the first few steps of that workflow by using the [JSME](https://jsme-editor.github.io/help.html) widget to draw molecules and convert to SMILES directly in the notebook. We can even use the `base_smiles` argument to specify a base molecular structure, which is great for generating derivatives. Here we'll set the base_smiles value to `'CC(C)CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(C)C(=O)O'`, the SMILES string for ibuprofen. Below is a screenshot using JSME to generate a few derivative molecules to test against our toxicity model.\n",

If you want to regenerate the original base molecule, in this case ibuprofen, click the `RESET TO BASE SMILES` button below the interface. By using this button, it's easy to generate distinct derivatives from a shared starting structure.  Go ahead and create some ibuprofen derivatives to test against the tox model:"

    "Building on the tutorial [Calculating Atomic Contributions for Molecules Based on a Graph Convolutional QSAR Model](https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem/blob/master/examples/tutorials/Atomic_Contributions_for_Molecules.ipynb), we can calculate the relative contribution of each atom in a molecule to the predicted output value. This attribution strategy enables us to determine whether the molecular features that a chemist may identify as important and those most affecting the predictions are in alignment. If the chemist's interpretation and the model's interpretation metrics are consistent, that may indicate that the model is a good fit for the task at hand. However, the inverse is not necessarily true either. A model may have the capacity to make accurate predictions that a trained chemist cannot fully understand. This is just one tool in a machine learning practitioner's toolbox.\n",
