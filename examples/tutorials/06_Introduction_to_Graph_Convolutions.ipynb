    "# What are Graph Convolutions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a standard convolutional neural network (CNN) of the sort commonly used to process images.  The input is a grid of pixels.  There is a vector of data values for each pixel, for example the red, green, and blue color channels.  The data passes through a series of convolutional layers.  Each layer combines the data from a pixel and its neighbors to produce a new data vector for the pixel.  Early layers detect small scale local patterns, while later layers detect larger, more abstract patterns.  Often the convolutional layers alternate with pooling layers that perform some operation such as max or min over local regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph convolutions are similar, but they operate on a graph.  They begin with a data vector for each node of the graph (for example, the chemical properties of the atom that node represents).  Convolutional and pooling layers combine information from connected nodes (for example, atoms that are bonded to each other) to produce a new data vector for each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Training a GraphConvModel\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use the MoleculeNet suite to load the Tox21 dataset. To featurize the data in a way that graph convolutional networks can use, we set the featurizer option to `'GraphConv'`. The MoleculeNet call returns a training set, a validation set, and a test set for us to use. It also returns `tasks`, a list of the task names, and `transformers`, a list of data transformations that were applied to preprocess the dataset. (Most deep networks are quite finicky and require a set of data transformations to ensure that training proceeds stably.)"
