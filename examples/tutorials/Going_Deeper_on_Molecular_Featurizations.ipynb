    "# Tutorial Part 7: Going Deeper On Molecular Featurizations\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important steps of doing machine learning on molecular data is transforming the data into a form amenable to the application of learning algorithms. This process is broadly called \"featurization\" and involves turning a molecule into a vector or tensor of some sort. There are a number of different ways of doing that, and the choice of featurization is often dependent on the problem at hand. We have already seen two such methods: molecular fingerprints, and `ConvMol` objects for use with graph convolutions. In this tutorial we will look at some of the others.\n",

    "\n",
    "We previously looked at graph convolutions, which use `ConvMolFeaturizer` to convert molecules into `ConvMol` objects.  Graph convolutions are a special case of a large class of architectures that represent molecules as graphs.  They work in similar ways but vary in the details.  For example, they may associate data vectors with the atoms, the bonds connecting them, or both.  They may use a variety of techniques to calculate new data vectors from those in the previous layer, and a variety of techniques to compute molecule level properties at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "DeepChem supports lots of different graph based models.  Some of them require molecules to be featurized in slightly different ways.  Because of this, there are two other featurizers called `WeaveFeaturizer` and `MolGraphConvFeaturizer`.  They each convert molecules into a different type of Python object that is used by particular models.  When using any graph based model, just check the documentation to see what featurizer you need to use with it."

    "### CoulombMatrix\n",
    "\n",
    "All the models we have looked at so far consider only the intrinsic properties of a molecule: the list of atoms that compose it and the bonds connecting them.  When working with flexible molecules, you may also want to consider the different conformations the molecule can take on.  For example, when a drug molecule binds to a protein, the strength of the binding depends on specific interactions between pairs of atoms.  To predict binding strength, you probably want to consider a variety of possible conformations and use a model that takes them into account when making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Coulomb matrix is one popular featurization for molecular conformations.  Recall that the electrostatic Coulomb interaction between two charges is proportional to $q_1 q_2/r$ where $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the charges and $r$ is the distance between them.  For a molecule with $N$ atoms, the Coulomb matrix is a $N \\times N$ matrix where each element gives the strength of the electrostatic interaction between two atoms.  It contains information both about the charges on the atoms and the distances between them.  More information on the functional forms used can be found [here](https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.058301).\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply this featurizer, we first need a set of conformations for the molecule.  We can use the `ConformerGenerator` class to do this.  It takes a RDKit molecule, generates a set of energy minimized conformers, and prunes the set to only include ones that are significantly different from each other.  Let's try running it for propane."

    "An important feature of Coulomb matrices is that they are invariant to molecular rotation and translation, since the interatomic distances and atomic numbers do not change.  Respecting symmetries like this makes learning easier.  Rotating a molecule does not change its physical properties.  If the featurization does change, then the model is forced to learn that rotations are not important, but if the featurization is invariant then the model gets this property automatically.\n",

    "Coulomb matrices are not invariant under another important symmetry: permutations of the atoms' indices.  A molecule's physical properties do not depend on which atom we call \"atom 1\", but the Coulomb matrix does.  To deal with this, the `CoulumbMatrixEig` featurizer was introduced, which uses the eigenvalue spectrum of the Coulumb matrix and is invariant to random permutations of the atom's indices.  The disadvantage of this featurization is that it contains much less information ($N$ eigenvalues instead of an $N \\times N$ matrix), so models will be more limited in what they can learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "`CoulombMatrixEig` inherits from `CoulombMatrix` and featurizes a molecule by first computing the Coulomb matrices for different conformers of the molecule and then computing the eigenvalues for each Coulomb matrix. These eigenvalues are then padded to account for variation in number of atoms across molecules."
