    "The MUV dataset is a challenging benchmark in molecular design that consists of 17 different \"targets\" where there are only a few \"active\" compounds per target. There are 93,087 compounds in total, yet no task has more than 30 active compounds, and many have even less. Training a model with such a small number of positive examples is very challenging.  Multitask models address this by training a single model that predicts all the different targets at once. If a feature is useful for predicting one task, it often is useful for predicting several other tasks as well. Each added task makes it easier to learn important features, which improves performance on other tasks [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, let's load the MUV dataset.  The MoleculeNet loader function automatically splits it into training, validation, and test sets.  Because there are so few positive examples, we use stratified splitting to ensure the test set has enough of them to evaluate."
