    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "GPAW (Grid-Based Projector-Augmented Wave Method) is a Python-based software for performing density functional theory (DFT) calculations. DFT is widely used in computational materials science to calculate electronic structure, total energy, forces, and other properties of materials at the atomic scale. This tutorial guides you through performing unit cell calculations with GPAW and explains all relevant concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Understanding Density Functional Theory (DFT)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a quantum mechanical modeling method used in computational chemistry and physics to investigate the electronic structure of many-body systems, particularly atoms, molecules, and solids. It is a crucial tool for understanding and predicting the properties of materials, from the behavior of individual atoms to the macroscopic properties of solid-state materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "The central idea of DFT is that the properties of a many-electron system can be determined by knowing the electron density, rather than the many-body wavefunction. In other words, instead of calculating the full wavefunction of a system (which is a complex and computationally expensive task), DFT simplifies the problem by focusing on the electron density, which is a function of just three spatial coordinates, not all the individual positions of the electrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **DFT is grounded in two theorems proposed by Hohenberg and Kohn in 1964**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **First Theorem**: The ground-state properties of a many-electron system are uniquely determined by the electron density.\n",
    "- **Second Theorem**: The electron density that minimizes the total energy of the system is the true ground-state density.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems show the existence of a functional for the total energy, the exact form of this functional is not known. However, Kohn and Sham developed a practical approach in 1965 that approximates the ground-state electron density and energy using a set of non-interacting reference systems. The solution involves solving a set of Kohn-Sham equations that describe the behavior of non-interacting electrons under an effective potential, which includes the effects of electron-electron interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In physics and quantum chemistry, specifically density functional theory, the Kohn–Sham equation is the non-interacting Schrödinger equation (more clearly, Schrödinger-like equation) of a fictitious system (the \"Kohn–Sham system\") of non-interacting particles (typically electrons) that generate the same density as any given system of interacting particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This eigenvalue equation is the typical representation of the Kohn–Sham equations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\left[ -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 + V_\\text{eff}(\\mathbf{r}) \\right] \\psi_i(\\mathbf{r}) = \\epsilon_i \\psi_i(\\mathbf{r}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ V_{eff}(r) $ is the effective potential that includes both the external potential and the electron-electron interaction effects.\n"

    "## **Setup**\n",
    "\n",
    "To install and set up GPAW, you need to ensure that all its dependencies, including libraries for numerical computations and compilers, are properly installed. The steps below outline a typical installation process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Required Libraries**: Use conda to install essential libraries like libxc and blas, which are crucial for GPAW's computational routines.\n",
    "2. **System Updates and Compiler Installation**: Update the system's package list and install the GCC compiler, as it is required for compiling GPAW.\n",
    "3. **Install GPAW**: Install GPAW directly from its GitLab repository using pip. Alternatively, you can use pip install gpaw for the latest stable version.\n",
    "4. **Installation of PAW datasets**: After installation, run the following command to download necessary auxiliary data for GPAW."

    "\n",
    "The **Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)** is a Python library for setting up, running, and analyzing atomistic simulations across various computational tools, including DFT codes like GPAW, VASP, and Quantum ESPRESSO. It allows users to create and manipulate atomic structures, perform geometry optimizations, molecular dynamics simulations, and compute properties like energies, forces, and vibrational spectra. ASE's core revolves around the **Atoms** object, which represents atomic systems, and **Calculators**, which interface with external simulation engines. It supports building crystals, surfaces, and clusters while enabling custom workflows through Python scripting. With its flexibility, extensibility, and integration of visualization and analysis tools, ASE is widely used for material science, catalysis, and chemical reaction studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "A unit cell is the smallest repeating structural unit of a crystal lattice that represents the overall symmetry and structure of the crystal. By repeating the unit cell in three-dimensional space, the entire crystal lattice can be reconstructed. Understanding unit cells is fundamental in crystallography, materials science, and solid-state physics.\n",

    "**Diamond Structure**: Silicon atoms form a tetrahedral network with a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice, characteristic of semiconductors like Si and Ge.\n",

    "## **Symmetry Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Symmetry plays a crucial role in computational materials science, significantly reducing the computational cost and improving the accuracy of simulations. By exploiting the inherent symmetry of a crystal structure, the number of atoms in the unit cell and the k-points in the Brillouin zone can be minimized while preserving the physical properties of the system. Symmetry also ensures that the results are consistent with the physical constraints of the material.\n",
