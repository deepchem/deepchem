        "**Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs)** are a class of targeted cancer therapies. They combine the target specificity of monoclonal antibodies with the cytotoxic potency of small-molecule drugs, offering a highly selective approach to destroying cancer cells while minimizing damage to healthy tissues.  \n",

        "### **2. Linker:**  \n",
        "- A chemical structure that connects the antibody to the drug.  \n",
        "- The linker must meet several requirements beyond just binding the antibody, which will be explored later.  \n",

        "\n",
        "### **1. Target Recognition**  \n",
        "- The **monoclonal antibody (mAb)** component of the ADC specifically recognizes and binds to **antigens** (usually proteins) expressed on the surface of target cells, often **cancer cells**.  \n",
        "- The antibody ensures high specificity by only binding to cells that express the **target antigen**.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Endocytosis of ADC-Antigen Complex**  \n",
        "- After binding to the **cell surface antigen**, the **ADC-antigen complex** undergoes **receptor-mediated endocytosis**.  \n",
        "- **Endocytosis** is the process by which a cell takes in substances from its surroundings by enclosing them in a portion of its plasma membrane.  \n",
        "- This internalizes the complex into the cell, forming an **early endosome**, which transports it deeper inside the cell.  \n",
        "- This step allows the drug to enter the cell in a **controlled and selective** manner.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Antigen Recovery and Trafficking**  \n",
        "- The endosome **matures** and traffics the ADC-antigen complex toward the **lysosome**.  \n",
        "- During this process:  \n",
        "  - The antigen may be **recycled back** to the **cell membrane**  \n",
        "  - Or it may be **degraded**  \n",
        "  - Meanwhile, the ADC itself is processed further inside the cell.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### **4. Lysosomal Degradation**  \n",
        "- Within the **lysosome**, the **acidic environment** and **proteolytic enzymes** break down the antibody component of the ADC.  \n",
        "- This degradation releases the **cytotoxic payload**, often a highly potent chemotherapeutic agent, which is conjugated to the antibody via a **linker**.  \n",
