    "## **What are ADCs?**\n",
    "Antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) are complex molecules designed to deliver highly toxic drugs specifically to cancer cells. An ADC is composed of three key elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Antibody**: A monoclonal antibody (mAb) that specifically recognizes and binds to antigens expressed predominantly on tumor cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linker**: A chemical connector that attaches the cytotoxic payload to the antibody. The linker is engineered to remain stable in the bloodstream and release the payload only once the ADC is internalized by the target cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Payload**: A highly potent cytotoxic agent that is too toxic for systemic administration on its own. Once released inside a cancer cell, the payload induces cell death."

    "## **Mechanism of Action**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Selective Targeting**: The antibody component binds to a tumor-associated antigen on the surface of cancer cells, ensuring that the ADC is delivered preferentially to the target cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Internalization and Trafficking**: Upon antigen binding, the ADC–antigen complex is internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis and transported to the lysosome.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Payload Release**: Within the lysosomal environment—often characterized by lower pH and specific proteolytic enzymes—the linker is cleaved, releasing the cytotoxic payload.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Induction of Cell Death**: The free payload then interacts with intracellular targets (e.g., tubulin or DNA), leading to apoptosis or other mechanisms of cancer cell death. In some cases, if the released drug is membrane-permeable, it can diffuse out of the target cell to kill neighboring tumor cells (the bystander effect).\n"

    "## **Computational Methods to Study ADCs**\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding ADC properties requires multiple computational techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Molecular Docking**: Predicts how a payload or linker molecule interacts with its target site (e.g., the antibody's conjugation site or receptor binding domain).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations**: Studies the stability of ADCs, mimics linker cleavage, and examines payload release kinetics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine Learning Approaches**: Predict critical properties like payload potency, membrane permeability, and overall ADC stability. DeepChem offers integrated tools (dataset handling, featurization, and model building) to streamline these analyses.\n"

    "**Dataset Handling**: Use NumpyDataset or DiskDataset to store molecular fingerprints, ECFP representations, or graph-based features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Featurizers**: Convert SMILES or molecular graphs into features. For ADC payloads, options include CircularFingerprint and GraphConvFeaturizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Training**: Use built-in models (e.g., MultitaskClassifier, MultitaskRegressor) to predict ADC properties such as cytotoxicity or permeability. Advanced modules allow hyperparameter optimization and early stopping to improve model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualization**: Build plots to assess model performance, such as ROC curves or scatter plots of predicted versus experimental values."
