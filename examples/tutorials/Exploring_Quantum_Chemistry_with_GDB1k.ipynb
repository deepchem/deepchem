    "Most of the tutorials we've walked you through so far have focused on applications to the drug discovery realm, but DeepChem's tool suite works for molecular design problems generally. In this tutorial, we're going to walk through an example of how to train a simple molecular machine learning for the task of predicting the atomization energy of a molecule. (Remember that the atomization energy is the energy required to form 1 mol of gaseous atoms from 1 mol of the molecule in its standard state under standard conditions).\n",

    "One issue that Coulomb matrix featurizations have is that the range of entries in the matrix $C$ can be large. The charge $q_1q_2/r^2$ term can range very widely. In general, a wide range of values for inputs can throw off learning for the neural network. For this, a common fix is to normalize the input values so that they fall into a more standard range. Recall that the normalization transform applies to each feature $X_i$ of datapoint $X$\n",
