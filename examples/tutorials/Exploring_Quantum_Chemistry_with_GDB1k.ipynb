    "One issue that Coulomb matrix featurizations have is that the range of entries in the matrix $C$ can be large. The charge $q_1q_2/r^2$ term can range very widely. In general, a wide range of values for inputs can throw off learning for the neural network. For this, a common fix is to normalize the input values so that they fall into a more standard range. Recall that the normalization transform applies to each feature $X_i$ of datapoint $X$\n",
