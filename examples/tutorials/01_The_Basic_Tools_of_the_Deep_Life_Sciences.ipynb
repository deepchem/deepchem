        "# Tutorial 1: The Basic Tools of the Deep Life Sciences\n",
        "Welcome to DeepChem's introductory tutorial for the deep life sciences. This series of notebooks is step-by-step guide for you to get to know the new tools and techniques needed to do deep learning for the life sciences. We'll start from the basics, assuming that you're new to machine learning and the life sciences, and build up a repertoire of tools and techniques that you can use to do meaningful work in the life sciences.\n",

        "**Scope:** This tutorial will encompass both the machine learning and data handling needed to build systems for the deep life sciences.\n",

        "at large pharmaceutical and biotech companies centered around AI. Learning and\n",

        "practitioners. By enabling the growth of open source tools for drug discovery,\n",

        "\n",
        "This tutorial will assume some basic familiarity with the Python data science ecosystem. We will assume that you have familiarity with libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, and TensorFlow. We'll provide some brief refreshers on basics through the tutorial so don't worry if you're not an expert.\n",
