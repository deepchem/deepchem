    "\n",
    "Traditional cancer chemotherapy, while effective in targeting rapidly dividing cells, often causes significant systemic toxicity due to its lack of selectivity, affecting both cancerous and healthy tissues. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) offer a promising alternative by specifically targeting tumor-associated antigens, enabling selective delivery of therapeutic agents to cancer cells. However, mAbs alone typically lack sufficient potency to eradicate tumors effectively. Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) address this limitation by combining the specificity of mAbs with the cytotoxic potency of chemotherapeutic drugs, delivering highly potent cytotoxic (cell-killing) payloads directly to tumor cells . This targeted approach enhances the therapeutic index of chemotherapeutic agents, minimizing off-target effects and improving patient outcomes."

    "\n",
    "Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) are a class of biopharmaceuticals designed for targeted cancer therapy, delivering potent cytotoxic (cell-killing) drugs directly to tumor cells while minimizing harm to healthy tissues. Unlike traditional chemotherapy, which often causes systemic toxicity due to non-specific action, ADCs leverage the precision of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to selectively bind tumor-associated antigens, ensuring the cytotoxic payload is released primarily within cancer cells. As of 2025, over 60 pharmaceutical companies are actively developing ADCs, with several, such as Brentuximab Vedotin and Trastuzumab Emtansine, approved for clinical use in treating hematological and solid tumors."

    "### Key Components of ADC\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of an ADC consists of three main components: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Monoclonal Antibody(mAb)** : The antibody used in ADCs should be specific for a tumor-associated antigen that has restricted expression on normal cells and overexpressed on cancer cells. This allows the ADC to selectively target cancer cells while sparing normal cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cytotoxic drug payload** : The payload is designed to kill target cells when internalized and released. These payloads are often drugs that are highly toxic and require antibodies to specifically target cancer cells so they do not affect healthy cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linker molecule** : A chemical bridge linking the mAb and payload, stable in circulation but designed to release the drug in tumor cells. Linkers (cleavable, e.g., Adcetris, or non-cleavable, e.g., Kadcyla) influence ADC stability, solubility, and toxicity."

    "\n",
    "ADCs revolutionize cancer treatment in many ways. Some of them are : \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Targeted Therapy**: Unlike traditional chemotherapy, which indiscriminately targets rapidly dividing cells and causes significant toxicity, ADCs selectively deliver cytotoxic (cell-killing) payloads to cancer cells, sparing healthy tissues and improving patient outcomes .\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhanced Therapeutic Index**: By focusing drug action on tumor cells, ADCs achieve higher efficacy at lower doses, reducing systemic side effects compared to conventional chemotherapies. Approved ADCs like Brentuximab Vedotin and Trastuzumab Emtansine have demonstrated significant clinical success in treating lymphomas and breast cancer, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Versatility Across Cancers**: ADCs can target a wide range of tumor-associated antigens, making them applicable to various cancers, including those resistant to standard treatments. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overcoming Resistance**: ADCs can address drug resistance by delivering novel payloads with distinct mechanisms of action, such as DNA-damaging agents or tubulin inhibitors, bypassing resistance pathways in cancer cells"

    "mAbs serve as the targeting moiety of ADCs, enabling selective binding to tumor-associated antigens. These antibodies are engineered to recognize antigens expressed predominantly on cancer cells, such as HER2 (breast cancer) or CD30 (lymphomas), while minimizing off-target effects on healthy tissues. The ideal mAb for ADCs exhibits high antigen affinity, efficient internalization upon binding, and low immunogenicity. <br>\n",

    "### 2.2 Importance of Cytotoxic Payloads : \n",
    "The ADCsâ€™ payloads play a key role in determining the efficacy of ADC drugs and thus have attracted great attention in the field. An ideal ADC payload should possess sufficient toxicity, low immunogenicity, stability in drug preparation and blood circulation and modifiable functional groups. Other characteristics including proper water solubility or bystander killing effect, though generally less essential, still have significant impacts on the effectiveness of an ADC. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.1 Classes of Payloads : \n",
    "ADC payloads are primarily categorized into three major classes based on their mechanism of action:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Class                     | Mechanism of Action                                              | Examples                                   |\n",
    "|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| Tubulin Inhibitors        | Disrupt microtubule dynamics, causing mitotic arrest and cell death | Auristatins (MMAE, MMAF), Maytansinoids (DM1, DM4), Tubulysins |\n",
    "| DNA Damaging Agents       | Induce DNA strand breaks or alkylate DNA, leading to apoptosis  | Calicheamicin, Duocarmycins, Pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBDs)     |\n",
    "| Topoisomerase I Inhibitors| Inhibit topoisomerase I, preventing DNA replication and transcription | Deruxtecan (DXd), SN-38                    |\n",
    "\n",
    "Common ADC payloads include tubulin inhibitors and DNA damaging agents, with tubulin inhibitors accounting for more than half of the ADC drugs in clinical development.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.2 Mechanism of Cytotoxicity :\n",
    "\n",
    "The mechanism of action of the payload is an important factor determining the performance of the ADC (For e.g., Adverse Reactions). Once an ADC is administered, it circulates in the bloodstream until it binds to its specific antigen on the surface of a tumor cell. This binding triggers the internalization of the ADCâ€“antigen complex, which is then transported to the lysosome inside the cell. Within the lysosome, the complex is degraded, and the cytotoxic payload is released. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The released payload then acts on its intracellular target-such as microtubules, DNA, or RNA-disrupting essential cellular functions and inducing cell death. Some payloads are designed to have a bystander effect, meaning they can diffuse out of the targeted cell and kill neighboring cancer cells that may not express the target antigen. This is especially useful in tumors where antigen expression is uneven. However, achieving this effect requires a careful balance, as highly membrane-permeable payloads can also increase toxicity to healthy tissues."

    "\n",
    "The linker connects the antibody and the cytotoxic payload and is a key component in the function of ADCs.<br>\n",

    "To be effective, a linker should be stable in plasma. It should not alter the behavior ofeither the drug or the antibody to which it is attached. The linker should be sufficiently hydrophilic to moderate or mitigate thesolubility effects of warheads, which, in most cases, are lipophilic.The linkers should not aggregate; since aggregation is likely to impair the activity of the antibody and may reduce the stability ofthe ADC. Finally, the linker should release the drug completelyand selectively under appropriate conditions. The choice oflinker will be determined by the functionality present on thedrug and the antibody. <br>\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Cleavable Linkers :\n",
    "\n",
    "The first type is the cleavable linkers, which has a chemical trigger in its structure that can be efficiently cleaved to release the cytotoxic payload in the tumor. They are engineered to remain stable in the bloodstream but to release the payload efficiently once inside the tumor environment. This release is triggered by specific conditions unique to tumors, such as acidic pH, elevated levels of certain enzymes, or a reductive environment. These linkers often contain chemical triggers that respond to these cues, ensuring that the cytotoxic drug is delivered primarily to cancer cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "More than 80% of the clinically approved ADCs employ cleavable linkers such as,  inotuzumab ozogamicin (Besponsa) and brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non-Cleavable Linkers :\n",
    "\n",
    " The other type of linker is noncleavable. In contrast to the cleavable linker, there are no chemical triggers in this structure, and the linker is part of the payload. This type of linker has been employed only in ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla, T-DM1) among the approved ADCs."

    "#### Challenges involved in Linker Design :\n",
    "\n",
    "Although ADCs have made remarkable strides in targeted cancer therapy, the continued advancement of this technology is increasingly limited by the challenges associated with linker design. Traditional linkers used in marketed ADCs present several significant drawbacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we move further, it is essential to know some of the challenges involved in Linker Design mentioned here -  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Firstly, many classical linkers are prone to nonspecific payload release in non-tumorous tissues, which can cause off-target toxicity and restrict the therapeutic window. A prominent example is gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg), which was withdrawn from the market in 2010 after reports of severe liver toxicity linked to its unstable N-acylhydrazone linker. Although Mylotarg was later re-approved in 2017 following a redesign, the FDA required a black-box warning due to the continued risk of liver toxicity. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Secondly, the commonly used maleimide-based linkers, such as succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC), are susceptible to retro-Michael elimination reactions. This instability can lead to a significant reduction in ADC efficacy over time. For example, studies have shown that the SMCC linker degrades to just 38% of its original form after 120 hours in mouse plasma, and Kadcyla, which contains an SMCC linker, exhibited a 29% decrease in drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) after seven days in mice. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Thirdly, the limited options for linkerâ€“payload attachment have become a bottleneck, especially as the field rapidly expands to include novel payloads for cancer treatment, antimicrobial therapy, and immune modulation. Many innovative payloads are awaiting suitable linker technologies to unlock their therapeutic potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "In response to these challenges, the past five years have seen significant progress in linker design. Key developments include the optimization of existing chemical triggers and the creation of novel triggers for highly selective linkers, the invention of new linkerâ€“antibody attachment strategies to produce more stable and homogeneous ADCs, the expansion of linkerâ€“payload attachment options to accommodate a wider range of payloads, and the refinement of linker properties to improve the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) profiles of ADCs."

    "### 2.4 Appropriate Drug To AntiBody Ratio (DAR) of ADC:\n",
    "\n",
    "Drugâˆ’antibody ratio (DAR) characterizes how many drug molecules an ADC can carry; theoretically, it should characterize the ability of an ADC to deliver drug to a tumor and thus positively correlate to effectiveness. However, the presence of large numbers of drugs (and thus large numbers of linkers) on an ADC perturbs the properties of the antibody. Lipophilic drugs and linkers increase the aggregation of ADC, preventing them from reaching their site of action; they may also hinder access to binding sites necessary for antigen recognition or binding, reducing the activity of the ADC. Reducing the lipophilicity of linker moieties has been used to reduce the negative consequences of antibody functionalization, but not the alteration in ADC properties. In addition, significant toxicity has been noted for ADC with high DAR (DAR â‰¥ 8) and high DAR may increase the clearance of ADC (reducing their residencetime and effectiveness). DAR is an important analytical property of ADC; the ability to produce ADC with consistent DAR is likely to lead to ADC with consistent properties and biological activity and thus is likely a critical attribute for ADC synthesis and production.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Let's take a look into how DAR is measured :\n",
