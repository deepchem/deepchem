### Getting Started with Examples

If you are new to DeepChem, it is recommended to start with the tutorial notebooks, as they provide step-by-step walkthroughs of common workflows and concepts. 
The API examples are useful once you are familiar with the core DeepChem abstractions and want to explore specific functionalities in more detail. 
Case study examples demonstrate how DeepChem can be applied to real-world scientific problems and are best explored after gaining some initial familiarity with the library.
